            This is the Observatory - a fan-maintainted site which allows you to track various per-player statistics of

          - if Observatory::Config::Piwik::ENABLED
            %p
              Yes, we are using

              Should you wish to not be tracked, then you can easily opt-out in one of two ways:
              %ul
                %li
                  Configure your browser to send the 'Do not track' header. This
                  can usually be done in the privacy settings. If possible, you
                  should choose this way, as it will persist even if you clear
                  cookies.

                  and uncheck the checkbox.

    %h2 Quering Players

        .panel-heading
          I can't find a player I'm looking for
        .panel-body
          %p
            If you are unable to find a player, then you can try to add them
            using their Steam ID. Mind that you can not add someone using their
            ingame nickname!

          My badges don't show up
        .panel-body
          %p
            If your badges don't show up, then this is likely due to one of two reasons:
            %ul
              %li
                If your Steam inventory is private, the site will be unable to
                retrieve your badges. As such, make sure your inventory is
                publicly accessible if you want your badges to show up.
              %li
                The PAX 2012 badge can not be tracked by this site, as it is managed in a special way.

      #faq-data-hivevsingame.panel.panel-default
        .panel-heading
          What is the difference between 'Hive' and 'Ingame' data?
        .panel-body
          %p
            Data listed below 'Hive' is tracked by Hive - a statistics system
            maintained by UWE, NS2's developers.
          %p
            Data listed below 'ingame' is based on NS2+/wonitor data which we
            automatically download from selected servers. We try to retrieve
            such data from many servers, to ensure that we are able to cover as
            many players as possible.

      #faq-data-hiveskill.panel.panel-default
        .panel-heading
          What is Hive skill?
        .panel-body
          %p
            Hive skill is a metric which is used to create balanced teams, by
            ensuring that the average skill of both teams is similar.
          %p
            It is based exclusively on your likelihood of winning games. If you
            win games it will tend to go up, whereas if you lose games it will
            tend to go down.
          %p
            How much your skill is adjusted at the end of the round depends on
            many factors:
            %ul
              %li
                Participating in the whole round will lead to a bigger skill
                adjustment than joining late.
              %li
                Being in an unbalanced team will barely, if at all, affect your
                skill if the team with lower skill lost, respectively affect
                your skill a lot if the team with lower skill won.
          %p
            Hive skill is tracked on all servers which are whitelisted - that
            is, those which show up as 'whitelisted' or 'ranked' in the ingame
            server browser.

      #faq-data-kdraccuracy.panel.panel-default
        .panel-heading
          How do you calculate KDR, accuracy etc?
        .panel-body
          %p
            KDR as well as accuracy are based on all rounds you played for
            which we have data.

      #faq-data-noadditionaldata.panel.panel-default
        .panel-heading
          I got a message that no additional data was available. What does this mean?
        .panel-body
          %p
            This means that you have never played on any of the servers for
            which we have additional data. If you would like this to change,
            you could contact the operators of the servers you play on, and ask
            them to get in contact with me.

      #faq-data-skill-tier.panel.panel-default
        .panel-heading
          Why do I have this skill tier badge?
        .panel-body
          %p
            Assignment of skill tier badges is mostly based on your Hive skill.
            However, it also takes into account the overall trend of your
            skill's development. As such, two people with skill 2000 might not
            necessarily have the same skill badge.

      #faq-data-rank-caching.panel.panel-default
        .panel-heading
          Why is my rank on the profile different from the leaderboard?
        .panel-body
          %p
            To ensure the profile page loads fast, the rank shown there is
            cached - meaning it is calculated once, and then reused for a
            while.

          %p
            Rank recalculation happens every few minutes, so will always be
            fairly up-to-date. None the less - especially if you are not near
            the beginning of the leaderboard - there will always be a slight
            discrepancy between the live rank shown on the leaderboard, and the
            one on the player profile.
